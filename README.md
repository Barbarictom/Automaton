# Current Issues:
- Form validation across the board
- DialogHosting for basic user-oriented messages. Like error windows, etc.
- Installation needs to be refined and a UI has to be added
- Loading dialogs for everything performance intensive
- Async for the above as well
- Redesign of the pre-installation view. I don't like how it meshes with the floating card design I used previously
- and some other stuff I cant remember
- ~~The install button doesn't quite seem to work~~
- SevenZipHandler is going to need a rewrite with DLL support, the 7za.exe method is too clunky

I'll get to these when I can, but we're getting closer.

# WIKI

Expect something here soon...
